Look closely and see a great battle being fought in plane sight! Your tribe of insects has found a new garden where you will prosper, and grow a great colony. This land clearly belongs to your tribe, but you are not the only one who feels this way. Gather resources to build an army to crush the interlopers, and defend your queen at all cost!
