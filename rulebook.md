# Garden Incursion!

Look closely and see a great battle being fought in plane sight! Your tribe of insects has found a new garden where you will prosper, and grow a great colony. This land clearly belongs to your tribe, but you are not the only one who feels this way. Gather resources to build an army to crush the interlopers, and defend your queen at all cost! 

##The Game

Garden Incursion is an augmented reality strategic card game that can be played with two or more players. It can be played on a table-top, a game board, or on a life-sized insect battle field! Each player begins the game with one “queen” creature on the battlefield, who can use “energy” created by her “worker” tokens to spawn other creatures, structures, or perform abilities represented by cards in your hand. Your goal is to move your creatures across the battlefield and destroy the apposing queen.

##The Components

### Cards

Garden Incursion is a card game, and uses cards to represent various game elements, and their effect on the game. All cards have text explaining their effects on the game. Creature and structure cards also have “stats”, which determine their effectiveness on the battlefield. If a card and the rulebook contradict one another, the card’s text takes precedence. The “energy cost” of a card represents a number of tokens deducted from your “energy pool” when the card is played. You many only play a card if there are enough energy tokens in your energy pool to cover the card’s cost.

###Hands

Each player will have a “hand”, which can hold up to 7 cards. These are the cards that may be played on your turn. If any game condition causes you to draw a card or add a card to your hand, you must immediately discard any excess cards of your choice until your hand has only 7 cards.

###Decks

Each player has a shuffled deck of cards. These are all of the cards that can potentially come into play during the game. The cards in each player’s deck must belong to the player’s respective tribe.

###Discard Pile

This is a face-up pile of cards who have been discarded or killed. Some cards may interact with the discard pile.

###The Battlefield

The battlefield is the stage where your war is set. Your queen, structures, and all other creatures have positions on the battlefield. The battlefield can be a tabletop, or a game board. However, to create an augmented-reality insect war, you may use any space as an AR (augmented reality) battlefield, such an apartment, or a real-life garden. There is no limitation to the size of the battlefield, as long as a reasonable “movement range” is agreed to before the game begins.

#####Movement Range

The “movement range” is a real-life distance agreed upon by all players before the game begins. During the “action” phase of each player’s turn, the movement range represents the distance around each creature in which it can move, and interact with other creatures and structures on the battlefield. The “movement range” may be measured in any unit of distance, such as meters, inches, tiles, squares, ect. There should be about 8 “movement ranges” between each queen’s starting position. The recommended movement range can be measured by a .5m (for AR battlefields) or 8cm (for tabletop battlefields) length of string, included with most Garden Incursion sets. Floor tiles, or grids on specially made game boards also make great movement range markers.

#####Staging Aria

It is often a good idea to designate a "staging aria" for each player. The staging aira is a place which is not part of the battlefield, where players can store thier hand, deck, worker cards, unused counter tokens, beer, or any other item they would like to keep away from the battlefield.

###The Queen

Each player commands one queen. The queen is a special creature card, capable of “spawning” other creatures. The objective of Garden Incursion is to destroy the other queen(s). When you control the last remaining queen, you win the game.

###Workers

Workers are special token cards that belong to your queen. At any time during your turn, each worker in play can be turned face-down, adding one “energy point” to your “energy pool”. Worker cards are not like creature cards, they do not have actions or a position on the battle field. 

###Energy

Energy is a currency that you can use to play cards and spawn creatures. Each card has an “energy cost” to play. Energy is deducted to your “energy pool when cards are played, which is reset at the end of your turn.  

###Counter Tokens

Counter tokens are tokens that can be placed on the battlefield to keep track of specific values that may change frequently during the game. For example, counter tokens could be used to maintain the remaining AP of a creature card, the energy pool, or to represent “buffs” applied to a creature. Some cards may instruct you to place counter tokens onto the battlefield, but it is ultimately up to the players to decide how to use these counter tokens. Color-coding these tokens may be useful, as they will have many different meanings in different contexts. 

##Tribes

Garden Incursion battles take place between tribes of insects fighting for control. Each player chooses a tribe to control, which determines the cards that may go into that player’s deck. Each card in Garden Incursion belongs to a specific tribe, and each players deck, including the queen, may only contain cards belonging to the same tribe. Each tribe also has a set of special skills as denoted on the tribal skill sheet. 

###Tribal Skills

Each tribe in Garden Incursion has a skill sheet, denoting special abilities and alternate rules that players may take advantage of. These skill sheets will make playing each tribe a vastly different experience. 

##Types of Cards

###Workers

Workers are typicaly 0-cost cards that can be played any time, and placed anywere on the battlefield (or any staging aria) face up. At any time durring your turn, any face-up worker card can be turned face-down, to add an energy point to your energy pool.

###Abilities

Ability cards in your hand can be played at any time during your turn, and have some mediate effect on the game, as stated in the card text. These cards are discarded after they are played. 

###Creatures

When played, creature cards are “spawned” onto the battlefield, within the “movement range” of the queen’s position. The card can be used to indicate it’s own position on the battlefield, or you may use a token to represent each creature, provided you have a way of tracking which token represents each creature. The creature’s ‘AP’ (action point) stat indicates the number of ‘actions’ it can perform each turn. “Action Points” are spent similar to the way “energy” is spent. 

#####Creature Actions

Each creature can perform a specific number of “actions” per turn. The actions a creature card can perform are as follows:

######Move
A creature can spend one action point moving to a new position on the battlefield, within the “movement range” of the creature’s last position. Creatures may move horizontally or vertically along any solid surface.

######Attack

A creature can spend an action point entering to enter a “skirmish” with any other creature within it’s current movement range.

######Defend

A creature can spend one action point to enter ‘defense’ mode, where the creature is declared a defender of another creature. The defender must be placed in the same position, or on top of the card he is defending. A creature with a defender can not enter a skirmish as long as the defender is alive. A defender must be in the same position as the card he is defending. Stacking creature cards is the best way to indicate a card is defending another. A creature can only have one defender, but defenders can be “stacked”. 

######Special Actions

Some cards may have special abilities with a specified AP cost.

###Structures

Structures are similar to creatures in that they have a position on the battlefield, can enter skirmishes, and have special effects and abilities. They differ in the way they are spawned, and that they do not have their own action points. Structures also can not attack, defend, or move.

######Spawning Strutures

In addition to the card’s energy cost, Each structure will specify the condition and location in which it can be spawned. 

######Structure Actions

Structures do not have action points. However, structures can spend action points of any creature within it’s own movement range to perform special actions.
