# Garden Incursion!

Look closely and see a great battle being fought in plane sight! Your tribe of insects has found a new garden where you will prosper, and grow a great colony. This land clearly belongs to your tribe, but you are not the only one who feels this way. Gather resources to build an army to crush the interlopers, and defend your queen at all cost! 

##The Game

Garden Incursion is an augmented reality strategic card game that can be played with two or more players. It can be played on a table-top, a game board, or on a life-sized insect battle field! Each player begins the game with one “queen” creature on the battlefield, who can use “energy” created by her “worker” tokens to spawn other creatures, structures, or perform abilities represented by cards in your hand. Your goal is to move your creatures across the battlefield and destroy the apposing queen.
