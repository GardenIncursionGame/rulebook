# Garden Incursion!

Look closely and see a great battle being fought in plane sight! Your tribe of insects has found a new garden where you will prosper, and grow a great colony. This land clearly belongs to your tribe, but you are not the only one who feels this way. Gather resources to build an army to crush the interlopers, and defend your queen at all cost! 

##The Game

Garden Incursion is an augmented reality strategic card game that can be played with two or more players. It can be played on a table-top, a game board, or on a "floortop" life-sized insect battle field! Each player begins the game with one “queen” creature on the battlefield, who can use “energy” created by her “worker” tokens to spawn other creatures, structures, or perform abilities represented by cards in your hand. Your goal is to move your creatures across the battlefield and destroy the apposing queen.

##The Components

### Cards

Garden Incursion is a card game, and uses cards to represent various game elements, and their effect on the game. All cards have text explaining their effects on the game. Creature and structure cards also have “stats”, which determine their effectiveness on the battlefield. If a card and the rulebook contradict one another, the card’s text takes precedence. The “energy cost” of a card represents a number of tokens deducted from your “energy pool” when the card is played. You many only play a card if there are enough energy tokens in your energy pool to cover the card’s cost.

###Hands

Each player will have a “hand”, which can hold up to 7 cards. These are the cards that may be played on your turn. If any game condition causes you to draw a card or add a card to your hand, you must immediately discard any excess cards of your choice until your hand has only 7 cards.

###Decks

Each player has a shuffled deck of cards. These are all of the cards that can potentially come into play during the game. The cards in each player’s deck must belong to the player’s respective tribe.

###Discard Pile

This is a face-up pile of cards who have been discarded or killed. Some cards may interact with the discard pile.

###The Battlefield

The battlefield is the stage where your war is set. Your queen, structures, and all other creatures have positions on the battlefield. The battlefield can be a tabletop, or a game board. However, to create an augmented-reality insect war, you may use any space as an AR (augmented reality) battlefield, such an apartment, or a real-life garden. There is no limitation to the size of the battlefield, as long as a reasonable “movement range” is agreed to before the game begins.

####Movement Range

The “movement range” is a real-life distance agreed upon by all players before the game begins. During the “action” phase of each player’s turn, the movement range represents the distance around each creature in which it can move, and interact with other creatures and structures on the battlefield. The “movement range” may be measured in any unit of distance, such as meters, inches, tiles, squares, ect. There should be about 4 “movement ranges” between each queen’s starting position. The recommended movement range can be measured by a .5m (for AR battlefields) or 8cm (for tabletop battlefields) length of string, included with most Garden Incursion sets. Alternatively, a “grid” or tiles could be used to define the movement range. 

###The Queen

Each player commands one queen. The queen is a special creature card, capable of “spawning” other creatures. The objective of Garden Incursion is to destroy the other queen(s). When you control the last remaining queen, you win the game.

###Workers

Workers are special token cards that belong to your queen. At any time during your turn, each worker in play can be turned face-down, adding one “energy point” to your “energy pool”. Worker cards are not like creature cards or structures, they do not have actions or a position on the battle field. 

###Energy

Energy is a currency that you can use to play cards and spawn creatures. Each card has an “energy cost” to play. Energy is deducted to your “energy pool when cards are played, which is reset at the end of your turn.  

###Counter Tokens

Counter tokens are tokens that can be placed on the battlefield to keep track of specific values that may change frequently during the game. For example, counter tokens could be used to maintain the remaining AP of a creature card, the energy pool, or to represent “buffs” applied to a creature. Some cards may instruct you to place counter tokens onto the battlefield, but it is ultimately up to the players to decide how to use these counter tokens. Color-coding these tokens may be useful, as they will have many different meanings in different contexts. 

##Tribes

Garden Incursion battles take place between tribes of insects fighting for control. Each player chooses a tribe to control, which determines the cards that may go into that player’s deck. Each card in Garden Incursion belongs to a specific tribe, and each players deck, including the queen, may only contain cards belonging to the same tribe. Each tribe also has a set of special rules and advantages as denoted on the tribal skill sheet. 

##Setting Up A Game

Garden Incursion is a complex game, with a lot of variation. There are a few things each player must agree upon before a game begins.

#####Choose a Rulebook Version

Garden Incursion is an always changing, open-source strategy game. At any given time, there may be many different versions, branches, and forks of this rulebook. To avoid future disputes, all players participating in a game must agree upon a version of this rulebook to use. This is also a good time to establish any house rules that will be in play.

#####Choose a Cardset

Anyone is welcome to create new, exciting cards that can be used to play Garden Incursion. There may be cards, tribes, and entire decks of cards created by the community. As a result, there may be cards and sets of cards that are far more powerful than others. It’s up to the players to insure that the cards used in the game lead to a fun, balanced game. Any restrictions or bans on any card sets or specific cards must be agreed upon before the game, at the digression of the players involved.

#####Choose a Battlefield
Garden Incursion can be played many ways. The game is designed to be played on a table top, like traditional miniature war games, or in an augmented reality setting. The players must define the location and boundaries if the battlefield, the “movement rage”, and the starting position of each player’s queen. It is recommended that the queens are placed roughly 4 “movement ranges” apart, but they can be closer for shorter games, or further to create longer games with larger, epic battles. Some game boards may supply their own variations of the official rules. 

####Choose Tribes and Construct your Decks

Each player must choose a tribe, and a deck of no more than 60 cards. Each player’s deck can be made of worker cards, and cards affiliated with their specific tribe. It is recommended that each player choose a different tribe, unless the players have some other way to keep track of which cards on the battlefield belong to each player. 

##Starting the Game

Once the players have a battlefield, decks, and starting positions, the game may begin. First, each player places their queen card in their queen starting position. Next, the decks are shuffled. Now the order in which players take turns begins. 

###Choose the Order of Turns

Each player draws a single card from their shuffled deck. The player with the highest cost card will have the first turn. The remaining turns will be taken clockwise around the staging aria.    
    
###Draw your Starting Hand

The player taking the first turn will draw 4 cards from their deck. The next player will draw one more card than the player before them. This continues until each player has a starting hand.    

####The Mulligan

Each player may perform one “mulligan”, in which a player may choose any cards from their starting hand, and shuffle them back into their deck. They may then re-draw cards until their starting hand reaches its original size.

##Begin!

Once each player has a deck, a starting hand, and a queen on the battlefield, the game may begin, starting with the player who was awarded the first turn.

##Turns

A turn is a set of phases in which the active player may perform a set of actions. The phases are as follows

###Reset Phase

The active player’s energy poll is reset to zero, and all creatures are granted their respective ability points.  

###Spawning Phase

The active player now draws one card from their deck. During this phase, each worker token in play can be “activated” once, adding one energy point to your energy poll. The active player may spend energy points to play cards from their hand.
###The Action Phase

Each creature and structure on the battlefield may now spend “action points” to perform the sanctioned actions, as specified by it’s card type. 

###Skirmish Phase

Each creatures who was attacked during the action phase now enter a “skirmish” with their attacker or attackers. In each skirmish, the sum of all of the attack power of the attacking creatures is dealt to the defending creature. The attack power of the defending creature is dealt to all attackers. If the damage dealt to a creature in a skirmish is greater than that creature’s defense power,  that creature is “dead”.  Dead creatures removed from the battlefield and placed in the discard pile.


##Victory
 When a player’s queen is dead, they are eliminated from the game. The last remaining player is the winner. 

##Types of Cards

###Abilities

Ability cards in your hand can be played at any time during your turn, and have some mediate effect on the game, as stated in the card text. These cards are discarded after they are played. 

###Creatures

When played, creature cards are “spawned” onto the battlefield, within the “movement range” of the queen’s position. The card can be used to indicate it’s own position on the battlefield, or you may use a token to represent each creature, provided you have a way of tracking which token represents each creature. The creature’s ‘AP’ (action point) stat indicates the number of ‘actions’ it can perform each turn. “Action Points” are spent similar to the way “energy” is spent. 

####Actions

Each creature can perform a specific number of “actions” per turn. The actions a creature card can perform are as follows:

#####Move
A creature can spend one action point moving to a new position on the battlefield, within the “movement range” of the creature’s last position. Creatures may move horizontally or vertically along any solid surface.

#####Attack

A creature can spend an action point to “attack” any other creature or structure within it’s movement range at the end of the action phase of the turn. 

#####Defend

A creature can spend one action point to “defend” any other creature or structure on the battlefield, as long as it is in the same position as the defended creature or structure at the beginning of the next turn. A creature with a defender can not be attacked as long as the defender is alive. A creature can only have one defender, but defenders can be “stacked”. 

#####Special Actions

Some cards may have special abilities with a specified AP cost.

###Structures

Structures are similar to creatures in that they have a position on the battlefield, can enter skirmishes, and have special effects and abilities. They differ in the way they are spawned, and that they do not have their own action points. Structures also can not attack, defend, or move.

####Spawning

In addition to the card’s energy cost, Each structure will specify the condition and location in which it can be spawned. 

####Special Actions

Structures do not have action points. However, structures can spend action points of any creature within it’s own movement range to perform special actions.
